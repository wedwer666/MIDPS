# MIDPS 4th Project

Pomodoro Application
 * Language: Swift 3
 * IDE: XCode

## Getting Started

1. Install IDE xcode on laptop
2. Create an apple id on: https://developer.apple.com/ Run the simulator on any device(it shoul be compatible)
3. Run the simulator on any device(it shoul be compatible)


## Running the tests

In order to run the test the user must press the button Run in the main directory.

### Some information about the Pomodoro Technique

 * The Pomodoro Technique is a time management method developed by Francesco Cirillo in the late 1980s.[1] The technique uses a timer to break down work into intervals, traditionally 25 minutes in length, separated by short breaks. These intervals are named pomodoros, the plural in English of the Italian word pomodoro (tomato), after the tomato-shaped kitchen timer that Cirillo used as a university student.

 * Closely related to concepts such as timeboxing and iterative and incremental development used in software design, the method has been adopted in pair programming contexts.

* There are six steps in the technique:

* Decide on the task to be done.
* Set the pomodoro timer (traditionally to 25 minutes).
* Work on the task until the timer rings.
* After the timer rings, put a checkmark on a piece of paper.
* If you have fewer than four checkmarks, take a short break (3â€“5 minutes), then go to step 2.
* Explain what these tests test and why


### And coding style tests

The user should test this application on different layouts and devices in order to test it's functionality.
